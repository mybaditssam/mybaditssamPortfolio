## Introduction
My React portfolio is all about giving you a glimpse into my world. It showcases my personal projects, provides insights into my background, and even lets you download my resume for a closer look.

## Features
1. Navigation: I've included a navigation component that makes it simple for you to switch between different sections of my portfolio, such as the About Me section and the Project Library.
2. About Me: In this section, you can get to know me better. I've shared information about my background, skills, and some personal details.
3. Project Library: The Project Library section is where you can explore my portfolio projects. Each project comes with descriptions, links, and images for your convenience. If you want to learn more about a project, just click on it.
4. Background: I've also added a background component that sets the tone and aesthetics of my portfolio, giving it a unique look and feel.
5. Bootstrap Integration: For styling, I've used Bootstrap, which ensures that the design is not only visually appealing but also responsive to different screen sizes.
6. Resume Download: You can download my resume directly from my portfolio to get a detailed overview of my qualifications and experiences.
7. Footer: At the bottom of the page, you'll find my contact information and links to my social profiles. Feel free to get in touch!
